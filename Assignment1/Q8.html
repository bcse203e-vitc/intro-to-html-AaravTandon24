        <p1>HTML entities are strings used to represent many reserved and invisible characters in HTML. These could be ‘<‘ or ‘>’ symbols, currencies (e.g. ‘€’ or ‘£’), and common signs such as quotation marks or, you guessed it, spaces.</p1>
        <p1>For example: $ 5 could appear as $5 or $<br>5, which is unfortunate. so we use nbsp like this to counter this .................... $&nbsp;5</p1>
